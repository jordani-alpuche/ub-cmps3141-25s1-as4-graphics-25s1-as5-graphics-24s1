        <h2>Design Principles Applied</h2>

        <div class="principle-section">
            <h3>1. Repetition</h3>
            <p>
                To unify the corporate identity, I used the principle of <strong>Repetition</strong> extensively. 
                I extracted the curved "wifi signal" shape from the main logo and repeated it as a large, decorative brown element in the bottom corners of both the Business Card and the Envelope. 
                Additionally, I repeated the specific icon set (green outlines) across all three designs to ensure the contact information always feels familiar and consistent.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-section">
            <h3>2. Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                I applied <strong>Contrast</strong> specifically in the typography. 
                For the employee name John Doe, I used a bold, heavy serif font, but for the job title Manager, I switched to a delicate script font. 
                This visual contrast creates an immediate hierarchy, separating the person's identity from their role. 
                I also utilized high color contrast by placing the dark brown text and graphics against the light beige background to ensure readability.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-section">
            <h3>3. Alignment</h3>
            <p>
                I used <strong>Alignment</strong> to keep the layouts clean and professional. 
                On the envelope and business card, the logo and text blocks are strongly left-aligned, creating a sharp invisible line that guides the eye. 
                On the letterhead, I used a horizontal alignment for the footer, balancing the contact information across the width of the page within the green bar.
            </p>
