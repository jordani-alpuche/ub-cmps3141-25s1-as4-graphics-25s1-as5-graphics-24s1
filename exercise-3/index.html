            <h2>Principle 1 (Group A): Simplicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Simplicity involves eliminating unnecessary elements to make the design clearer and easier to understand. It focuses on the "less is more" approach.</p>

                    <h3>Ministry of Natural Resources</h3>
                    <a href="https://naturalresources.gov.bz/" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/mnr-clutter.png"></a>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This layout violates the principle of <strong>Proximity</strong> because the sidebar lists, service links, and contact details are packed tightly together without sufficient whitespace, creating a cluttered visual section where distinct categories are difficult to distinguish.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvement:</strong> I would improve this by adding significant padding (whitespace) between the Online Services and Department sections to create clear visual groups, allowing the user to instantly recognize the separation between different topics.</p>

                    <h3>TravelBelize.org</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.travelbelize.org/" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/travel-belize-clean.png" /> </a>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This website excellent follows simplicity  by using large, high-quality images and minimal text. The navigation is reduced to just a few key options (Destinations, Things to Do), allowing the user to focus without being overwhelmed.</p>

            <h2>Principle 2 (Group B): Proximity</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proximity states that related items should be grouped together visually. This helps the user understand organization and relationship between elements.</p>
            
            <div class="comparison-grid">
                <article class="example-card card-violation">
                    <span class="status-badge status-violation">Violates</span>
                    <h3>San Pedro Sun Classifieds</h3>
                   <a href="https://www.sanpedrosun.com/classifieds/" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/sun-classifieds.png" /></a>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The text ads are stacked directly on top of one another with equal spacing, making it difficult to distinguish where one ad ends and the next begins (e.g., a "Job Vacancy" looks related to a "For Rent" ad).</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvement:</strong> I would increase the vertical margin between distinct ads and perhaps add a light border or background color to each individual listing to clearly separate them.</p>

                    <h3>TropicAir.com</h3>
                   <a href="https://www.tropicair.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/tropic-proximity.png"></a>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The flight booking tools (Search, Check-In, Status) are grouped tightly together in a dedicated bar, visually separating them from the marketing images. This signals to the user that these inputs function as a single unit.</p>
